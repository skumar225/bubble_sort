# Sorting Algorithms

## Learning Objectives
* Describe how a Bubble Sort is performed and its time complexity
* Implement a sorting algorithm in ruby
* Offer a solution to optimize the algorithm

## To do

* Run the `rspec` command in the root directory of this project.

* Use our pseudo code in class to try to get the tests to pass

## Hint
* Check the [pseudo code listed on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort). Make sure you understand how it works.
